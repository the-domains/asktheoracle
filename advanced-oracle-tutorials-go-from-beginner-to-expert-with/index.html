This was shown in the above example. However, they can also be used in other parts of SQL statements, specifically:</p><ul><li>in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement instead of a table name (known as an in-line view);</li><li>to provide the new values for the specified columns in an UPDATE statement.</li><li>in INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements instead of a table name;</li><li>in the WHERE, HAVING and START WITH clauses of SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements to define the limiting set of rows</li><li>to define the set of rows to be included by a view or a snapshot in a CREATE VIEW or CREATE SNAPSHOT statement or the set of rows to be created in the target table of a CREATE TABLE AS or INSERT INTO statement;</li></ul><p>The example shown earlier used a simple equality expression. In that case we were interested in only one row from the sub query. We can also use the sub query to provide a set of rows, though. For example, to find the names of all Oracle tutorials written by either Andy McKay or Nick Sale, the following SQL statement could be used:</p><p>SELECT</p><p>tutorial_</p><p>name</p><p>FROM oracle_tutorial WHERE author_id IN</p><p>(</p><p> SELECT author_id FROM author</p><p> WHERE author_name IN ('Andy McKay','Nick Sale')</p><p>)</p><p>In fact, the original example could also return more than one row from the sub-query if there were two or more authors with the name Andy McKay in our set of Oracle tutorials. In that case, the first example would cause a run-time SQL error, though, because by using '=' we specified that the sub query should produce no more than one row (it is perfectly legitimate for a sub query to return no rows).</p><p>The question can also be reversed to ask for the names of all the Oracle tutorials that were NOT written by Andy McKay. To do this, the sense of the sub query just has to be reversed by prefixing it with 'NOT' or '!'.</p><p>SELECT</p><p>tutorial_</p><p>name</p><p>FROM oracle_tutorial WHERE author_id</p><p>NOT IN</p><p>(</p><p> SELECT author_id FROM author</p><p> WHERE author_name = 'Andy McKay'</p><p>)</p><p>Or</p><p>SELECT</p><p>tutorial_</p><p>name</p><p>FROM oracle_tutorial WHERE author_id</p><p>!=</p><p>(</p><p> SELECT author_id FROM author</p><p> WHERE author_name = 'Andy McKay'</p><p>)</p><p>sub-queries. This time we want to find the free cover limits of all ratings for all covers on all policies with an end date after 01-Jan-2009. This could be written as follows:</p><p>SELECT free_cover_limit FROM rating</p><p>WHERE cover_type IN</p><p> ( SELECT cover_type FROM cover_type</p><p> WHERE policy_no IN</p><p> ( SELECT policy_no FROM policy</p><p> WHERE end_date > '01-JAN-2009'))</p><p>Any of the other comparison operators instead of '=' or 'IN' such as '<',>' can also be used.</',></p><p>The <a href="http://www.asktheoracle.net/oracle-tutorials-advanced-2.html">next</a> in our series of Oracle tutorials will look at using sub-queries in the from clause and correlated sub-queries.<br>Follow this link to learn about the various types of <a href="http://www.asktheoracle.net/oracle-sql-joins.html">SQL joins</a>.</p><h2>Looking for instructor-led Oracle training?</h2><p><a href="http://www.smart-soft.co.uk/oracle-and-unix-training.htm">Learn Oracle </a>with Smartsoft to advance your skills and sky rocket your career.</p><p><a href="http://www.asktheoracle.net/">Return</a> from advanced Oracle tutorials to <a href="http://asktheoracle.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asktheoracle.net</a> home page</p><p><a href="http://www.asktheoracle.net/index.html"></a><a href="http://www.asktheoracle.net/index.html"></a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="31"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="32">Advanced Oracle Tutorials - Go From Beginner To Expert With Real-World Examples</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
