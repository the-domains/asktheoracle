PL/SQL is Oracle's proprietary,block-structured, strongly-typed, procedural programming language for manipulating data and interacting with the database.

The procedural part is important - the language provides you with all the things that SQL lacks like user-defined functions, loops, control statements (though SQL does provide some control in the form of the CASE clause, and the DECODE and NVL functions.). In fact the name stands for "Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language".

Overall PL/SQL is a high-level language very similar to Pascal and ADA (from which it is derived). As Pascal was designed as a teaching language, this makes it easy to learn and to use and it promotes good programming practice. Although it is still possible to write bad code you just have to try that bit harder to do so!
