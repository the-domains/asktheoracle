In an Oracle database all data is ultimately stored in files on one or more disks. Which files are on which disk is not really relevant to our discussion - storage may be virtualised or may be managed by a special type of Oracle instance called ASM (Automatic Storage Management). The disks may also be formatted with a flie system or may be just raw devices (on Unix/Linux systems).

Therefore, the least granular object in the Oracle database architecture is the data file (ignoring physical objects such as disks, disk partitions, logical volumes, etc.) and every database must have at least one data file.

A data file is a physical structure that contains a tablespace which is a logical structure. A data file can hold only one tablespace but a tablespace may extend over more than one datafile. 

A tablespace is a logical grouping of segments, usually of one type but not necessarily so. A tablespace may therefore mix index and table sgements.

A segment is a logical grouping of extents of one type of database object (index ,table, undo, temporary). A segment may span several data files but cannot span more than one tablespace.

An extent comprises one or more contiguous Oracle data blocks allocated in one go. An Oracle block may be an integral multiple of physical blocks on the disk.
